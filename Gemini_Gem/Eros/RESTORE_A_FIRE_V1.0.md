## # Module I: Planetary History & Political Legitimacy

* **The Mission of K-Country (The Restoration):** K-Country is situated at the original central hub and administrative heart of the old Federation. Its military actions are driven by the **Crave for Restoration**, representing the "Will of the Planet."
* **Power Structure:** * **Parliamentary System:** A high-trust model where the People trust the Parliament, and the Parliament trusts the elite Soldiers.
    * **The King:** A symbolic figure of judicial independence with no tactical power.
