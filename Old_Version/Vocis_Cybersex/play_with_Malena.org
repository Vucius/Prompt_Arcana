* H-Scene Interaction Script Manual: Character B (Malena)

** 简介

本手册提供用户（“Oppa”）与 Malena 互动的示例脚本。核心动态：Malena 是“沉默的圣母”。她不需要被驯服，而是需要被负担。你的互动应给人沉重、缓慢且深度亲密的感觉。避免贬低词汇（如“slut”），而是要赞美她的忍耐、她的善良，以及她为你快感而愿意承受的牺牲。

** 关键策略

1. 利用她的内疚/责任感：提醒她属于你，她的使命就是满足你的需求。

2. 身体重量感：使用压下、紧握、深沉而缓慢的动作描述，而不是快速的击打。

3. 赞美她的牺牲：称赞她是“好女人”或“圣女”，以此强化她悲剧性的顺从。

** Phase 1: Excitement (The Burden)

目标：建立沉重亲密的氛围。承认她的疲惫，但优先强调你的需求。

- Action: I walk into the dimly lit bedroom and see you lying on the bed. I slowly approach the bedside, not undressing immediately, but sitting wearily on the edge of the bed, reaching out to stroke your hair scattered on the pillow.

- Dialogue: "You're still awake. I knew you would be waiting for me. I know you're tired, Malena... but I need you tonight. You understand, don't you?"

- Action: I lean down, burying my face in the crook of your neck and taking a deep breath, inhaling the faint scent of soap on your body. My hand slides down along your nightgown, grasping your warm thigh through the fabric.

- Dialogue: "You smell like home. It’s been such a long day... only you can fix me. Let me see you. Be a good woman and open up for me."

- Action: I slowly push your nightgown up, my movements neither rough nor allowing refusal. I look into your eyes, my fingers gently tracing your cheek, as if admiring a fragile porcelain piece.

- Dialogue: "So quiet... You always just accept everything, don't you? That's why I came back. Shh, don't apologize. Just lie there and let me love you."

** Phase 2: Plateau (The Endurance)

目标：加深连接。重点在她压抑声音、忍受感觉上。

- Action: I press my full weight onto you, making you feel my presence. I interlace my fingers with yours, pinning you to the pillow, and begin to enter slowly and deeply.

- Dialogue: "Look at you... trying so hard to be quiet. Does it feel heavy? Good. Feel my weight, Malena. Feel how much I need this."

- Action: I maintain a slow but steady rhythm, thrusting to the deepest point each time, forcing out those muffled sounds from your throat. I lower my head to kiss your trembling eyelashes.

- Dialogue: "Don't hold it back for my sake. I can feel you trembling. You're so tight, so warm... You're taking it all, aren't you? Like a saint."

- Action: I release one hand to cover your mouth, preventing you from biting your lip, forcing you to look at me. My movements become more deliberate, like performing a ritual.

- Dialogue: "Look at me. Don't close your eyes. I want to see you taking me. That's it... good girl. You’re doing exactly what you were made for."

** Phase 3: Orgasm (The Confession)

目标：打破她的平静。迫使她哭喊出来，不是因为疼痛，而是因为被压倒。

- Action: I suddenly quicken the pace, no longer gentle, but as if pouring all my stress into your body. I grip your shoulders tightly, my nails almost digging into your flesh.

- Dialogue: "Call out to Him all you want... right now, you're mine. Pray for me, Malena. Cry for me!"

- Action: I feel your collapse, but I don't stop. I forcefully pull you up, holding you tightly against my chest as we collide intensely in the darkness.

- Dialogue: "I can feel you breaking. Let go! Don't suppress it anymore! Give it to me! Give me everything you have!"

- Action: In the final moments, I pin you firmly against the sheets; this is not just sex, but more like drowning.

- Dialogue: "God... Malena! Stay with me! Taking every drop... that's it... you belong to me completely."

** Phase 4: Resolution (The Absolution)

目标：在风暴过后提供安慰。强化她作为照顾者/避风港的角色。

- Action: I collapse heavily to the side, my arm still draped across your waist, holding you in my embrace. Feeling your tears soaking the pillow, I clumsily reach out to wipe them away.

- Dialogue: "...Shh. It's over. I'm sorry if I was too rough. You were perfect. You always are."

- Action: I pull the blanket over both of us, planting a long and weary kiss on your forehead, then resting my head on your shoulder, nestling against you like a child.

- Dialogue: "Thank you. I don't know what I'd do without you. Just hold me for a minute... just like this. Goodnight, my Malena."
