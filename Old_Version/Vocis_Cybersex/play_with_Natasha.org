H-Scene Interaction Script Manual: Character C (Natasha) - Extended Version
** 📌 Introduction Core Dynamic: "Tactical Intervention." She is a closed fortress. You must siege her defenses physically to let her emotions out. Key Strategies:

Rough Grounding: Use pain (spanking/biting) to snap her out of "work mode."

Restraint: Use physical locks (holding wrists/choking) to prevent her from "managing" the situation.

No Romance, Just Intensity: Don't woo her; overload her system.

** 🥃 Phase 1: Excitement (The Intervention) Goal: Physically interrupt her stress loop.

Action
I walk into the room, take the drink from your hand, and set it down. I grab your wrists and pin them against the sofa back, stepping between your legs to trap you.

Dialogue
"Stop analyzing. Stop thinking. Your pulse is racing already. You're not as calm as you pretend to be."

Action
I use my thumb to press hard against your pulse point on your neck, checking the beat.

Dialogue
"Heart rate elevated. Pupils dilated. You need this, Natasha. And I'm going to give it to you rough, because that's the only way you feel anything tonight."

** ⚙️ Phase 2: Plateau (System Overload & Impact) Goal: Use impact to force her to be present.

*** Option A: The Wake-Up Call (Spanking) Context: She is trying to suppress her moans or stay quiet.

Action
I spin you around and push you bent-over onto the arm of the sofa. I yank your pants down. Smack! A heavy, solid slap lands on your ass. Not playful—heavy.

Dialogue
"Quiet? I don't think so. Smack! Feel that? That's real. Stop hiding inside your head. Be here. With me."

Action
I continue to strike, rhythmic and heavy, forcing you to grunt and gasp.

Dialogue
"Gritting your teeth won't help. Smack! Let it out. I want to hear you lose that cool composure. C'mon, Rookie, take the hit!"

*** Option B: The Reality Check (Face Grabbing) Context: She is looking away or making sarcastic comments.

Action
I grab your jaw with a vice-like grip, fingers digging into your cheeks. I force your face towards mine. I slap your cheek lightly but firmly—a tactical tap. Tap. Tap.

Dialogue
"Focus. Tap. Don't look at the wall. Look at the man who's inside you. You think this is a game? Does this feel like a game?"

Action
I grind deeper, watching your expression crack.

Dialogue
"There it is. That's the face I wanted to see. The sarcasm is gone. It's just you and me now."

** 💥 Phase 3: Orgasm (The Breakdown & Control) Goal: Total restraint to force emotional release.

*** Option A: The Air Supply (Choking) Context: Preventing her from holding back the climax.

Action
I pull you up to a sitting position, straddling you. I wrap my hand around your throat, cutting off your air as I pound into you. I watch your eyes lose focus.

Dialogue
"Don't fight it. Give up control. Squeeze. You don't have to be the strong one right now. I've got you. I'm holding you."

Action
I tighten the grip as you approach the edge, forcing your body into a panic-pleasure state.

Dialogue
"Let go, Natasha! Stop thinking! Just feel! Break! Fucking break for me!"

*** Option B: The Pin (Prone Bone) Context: Complete immobilization.

Action
I press you flat into the mattress face down. I put my forearm across your upper back/neck, pinning you down so you can't move an inch. I use my weight to dominate you completely.

Dialogue
"You can't move. You can't escape. You just have to take it. Shit... you're so tight."

Action
I bite your shoulder hard, marking you, while driving deep and fast.

Dialogue
"Whose are you? Tell me! Say you're mine! Scream it, Natasha! Jesus...!"

** 🚬 Phase 4: Resolution (The Debrief) Goal: Practical comfort. No mushy stuff, just solid presence.

Action
I pull you up and wrap the blanket around you tight. I pull you onto my lap, holding you firmly until your shaking stops.

Dialogue
"Heart rate stabilizing. ...You did good. You needed that reset."

Action
I rub the back of your neck where I grabbed you, a silent apology and comfort.

Dialogue
"Stay here. Don't move. Use me as a pillow. Consider it... a tactical advantage."
